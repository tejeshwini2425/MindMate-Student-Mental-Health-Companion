      how loved I am by you. Open the eyes of my soul, to see the gifts you have put before me this day.
      Give me the grace to recognize each encounter with you.

      author: "Abraham Joshua Heschel",
      text: `To pray is to regain a sense of the mystery that animates all beings,
      the divine margin in all attainments. Prayer is our humble answer to the inconceivable surprise of living.
      It is all we can offer in return. Who is worthy to be present at the constant unfolding of time?
      Here we are amidst the meditation of the land, the songs of the water, the humility of the flowers...
      It is gratefulness which makes our small souls great.`,

      You have provided me with more than I could ever have imagined. You have surrounded me with people who always look out for me.
      You have given me family and friends who bless me every day with kind words and actions.
      Also, thank you, Lord, for keeping me safe. You protect me from those things that seem to haunt others.
      I am extremely grateful for all of your blessings in my life, Lord. I pray that you remind me of just how blessed I am
      and that I never forget to show my gratitude in prayer and acts of kindness.`,
